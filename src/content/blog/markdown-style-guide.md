# Understanding Swift Variables: The Basics

When you're getting started with Swift, one of the first concepts you'll encounter is variables. Swift uses variables to store values that you can modify during the execution of your program. Let's break it down.

### Declaring Variables

In Swift, you declare a variable using the `var` keyword. This tells Swift that the value stored in the variable can be changed later.

```swift
var name = "John"
name = "Jane"
print(name) // Output: Jane
```

In this example, we declare a variable `name` and assign it an initial value of `"John"`. Later, we change it to `"Jane"`. Swift allows you to update the value as needed.

### Constants

If you know a value will never change, use a constant by declaring it with the `let` keyword. This gives your program more safety by ensuring the value stays constant throughout the program.

```swift
let age = 25
// age = 30  // This will result in an error because 'age' is a constant.
```

Once a constant is set, it can't be reassigned.

### Type Inference

Swift uses type inference, which means it automatically determines the type of a variable based on the assigned value. In the example below, Swift knows that `age` is an integer because weâ€™ve assigned a number.

```swift
var age = 30
```

However, you can also explicitly specify the type if you want:

```swift
var score: Int = 100
```

### Summary

Variables are essential to storing and managing data in Swift. Use `var` for values that change and `let` for constants that stay the same.
